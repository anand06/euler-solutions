 2 The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:
 3
 4 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
 5
 6 Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:
 7
 8  1: 1
 9  3: 1,3
10  6: 1,2,3,6
11 10: 1,2,5,10
12 15: 1,3,5,15
13 21: 1,3,7,21
14 28: 1,2,4,7,14,28
15 We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

17 What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?
